# FMC stuff

My tools and notes regarding the 3×3×3 Fewest Moves event, also known as Fewest Moves Challenge (FMC). While solving the classic Rubik's Cube in the minimal number of moves is an easy task for modern computers, this is not the case for human solvers.

I'm half-retired from practising FMC so don't expect frequent updates.

## DR "trainer"

Currently, this tool only includes a scramble generator. There are a few other features I have in mind, but it's unlikely I'll get around to implementing them any time soon.

The scrambles optionally include R' U' F padding a la official FMC scrambles.
